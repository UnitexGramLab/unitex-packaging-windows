# Unitex/GramLab Setup Installer for Windows  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/UnitexGramLab/unitex-packaging-windows.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/UnitexGramLab/unitex-packaging-windows)

> [Unitex/GramLab][unitex] is an open source, cross-platform, multilingual, lexicon- and grammar-based corpus processing suite.

This NSIS script is used to create the [Unitex/GramLab][unitex] setup installers
for Windows ([32-bit][installer32] and [64-bit][installer64]) on POSIX compliant
systems. NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) is a scripting tool to create
Windows installers. Installers are generated by using the `makensis` program to
compile a NSIS script (.nsi) into an executable. NSIS is released under an open
source license and is completely free for any use. For more details,
please visit the [nsis website][nsis].

## Script dependencies

- **NSIS** distribution (version >= 3.0). Type `makensis -VERSION` to test your version.  
  If you need an update version, please visit [nsis]
- **GNU awk** (version >= 3.0) Type `awk --version` to test your version.  
  If you need an update version, please visit http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/

## Script compilation

    Usage:
    makensis -DVER_MAJOR=# -DVER_MINOR=# -DVER_REVISION=# [OPTIONS] unitex.nsi

For a full list of compiler flags supported by this program, just type
`makensis unitex.nsi` [return] at the command line. For a full list of
parameters and further information about the makensis command, type
`makensis` [return]. 

## Example

> Before beginning, please remember that this program only compiles on
> POSIX compliant systems (i.e. not on Windows). This is mainly due to the use
> of the `!system` command thats runs with /bin/sh. There aren't any plans for
> a Windows support at the moment.

1. Download the [Unitex/GramLab package source](http://unitex.univ-mlv.fr/releases/latest-stable/source/Unitex-GramLab-3.1-source-distribution.zip)
   containing the Unitex/GramLab source distribution.
2. Unzip all files in a folder at one time.
3. Take notice of the main folder name:  
   `Unitex-GramLab-${VER_MAJOR}.${VER_MINOR}${VER_SUFFIX}`, e.g.  
   **Unitex-GramLab-3.1**      `VER_MAJOR=3 VER_MINOR=1 VER_SUFFIX=""`  
   **Unitex-GramLab-3.1rc**  `VER_MAJOR=3 VER_MINOR=1 VER_SUFFIX="rc"`
4. Take notice of the parent folder name, i.e. the directory where the  
   Unitex/GramLab distribution directory is placed. This directory will be your `${INPUT_BASEDIR}` location.
5. Create the final setup installer typing:  
   `makensis -DANONYMOUS_BUILD  -DINPUT_BASEDIR=path -DVER_MAJOR=number -DVER_MINOR=number -DVER_SUFFIX=suffix unitex.nsi`  
   For example:  
   `makensis -DANONYMOUS_BUILD  -DINPUT_BASEDIR=. -DVER_MAJOR=3 -DVER_MINOR=1 -DVER_SUFFIX=beta unitex.nsi`  
   This will create an executable named: `Unitex-GramLab-3.1beta_anonymous_win32-setup.exe`

Non-anonymous builds are further documented [here](unitex.nsi)

## Setup installer command line parameters

The produced Unitex/GramLab Windows setup installer accepts several optional
command line parameters. Some common options are:

| Option                     | Description                                           |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `/AllUsers`                  | Set default to a per-machine installation             |
| `/CurrentUser`               | Set default to a per-user installation.               |
| `/D C:\path\without quotes\` | Sets the default installation directory. It mustbe the last parameter and must not contain any quotes. Only absolute paths are supported|
| `/NCRC`                      | The installer will not perform a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) on itself before allowing an install     |
| `/S`                         | Runs the installer or the uninstaller silently        |

Support questions can be posted in the [community support
forum](http://forum.unitexgramlab.org). Please feel free to submit any
suggestions or requests for new features too. Some general advice about

## Reporting Bugs

See the [Bug Reporting
Guide](http://unitexgramlab.org/index.php?page=6) for information on
how to report bugs.

## Governance Model

Unitex/GramLab project decision-making is based on a community
meritocratic process, anyone with an interest in it can join the
community, contribute to the project design and participate in
decisions. The [Unitex/GramLab Governance
Model](http://governance.unitexgramlab.org) describes
how this participation takes place and how to set about earning merit
within the project community.

## Spelling

Unitex/GramLab is spelled with capitals "U" "G" and "L", and with
everything else in lower case. Excepting the forward slash, do not put
a space or any character between words. Only when the forward slash
is not allowed, you can simply write “UnitexGramLab”.

It's common to refer to the Unitex/GramLab Core as "Unitex", and to the
Unitex Project-oriented IDE as "GramLab". If you are mentioning the
distribution suite (Core, IDE, Linguistic Resources and others bundled
tools) always use "Unitex/GramLab".
